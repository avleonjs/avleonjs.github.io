## Overview

Avleon is a powerful, TypeScript-based web framework built on top of Fastify, designed to simplify API development with a focus on decorators, dependency injection, and OpenAPI documentation. It provides a robust set of tools for building scalable, maintainable web applications with minimal boilerplate code.


## üß† Why AvleonJs Instead of NestJS or Fastify?

While both **NestJS** and **Fastify** are excellent frameworks, **AvleonJs** was created to fill specific architectural and developer-experience gaps:

### üî© 1. **Built for Composition, Not Convention**

Unlike NestJS which relies heavily on decorators and rigid architectural patterns, AvleonJs embraces flexibility and composability. It provides structured primitives‚Äîwithout enforcing a full-blown framework‚Äîthat let you build apps how **you** want.

### ‚ö° 2. **Fastify Inside, But Cleaner Outside**

Fastify is used under the hood for raw performance. But working with Fastify directly often leads to boilerplate and repetitive patterns. AvleonJs abstracts those pains while still exposing Fastify-level control when needed.

### üßº 3. **Minimal Magic**

NestJS introduces a lot of ‚Äúmagic‚Äù (e.g., metadata reflection, global context injection) that can make debugging and testing harder. AvleonJs favors **explicitness over cleverness**, enabling better traceability, testability, and understanding.

### üß™ 4. **Testable by Design**

Inspired by modular DI patterns and functional programming principles, AvleonJs applications are **easy to test**‚Äîwithout needing to run the whole app or rely on global state.

### üöÄ 5. **Smaller, Leaner, Sharper**

AvleonJs ships with a smaller footprint and avoids heavyweight dependencies when they aren't needed. It‚Äôs ideal for modern applications that need precision, performance, and control.


## What AvleonJS is Not
- Not a full-stack framework ‚Äì AvleonJS focuses solely on the backend. It does not prescribe or bundle frontend tools, unlike full-stack frameworks such as Blitz.js or RedwoodJS.

- Not a clone of NestJS ‚Äì While AvleonJS may use decorators and DI like NestJS, it is not built on Express or Fastify and avoids heavy abstractions. It follows its own minimal and real-time-oriented design principles.

- Not tightly coupled to HTTP ‚Äì AvleonJS is transport-agnostic. While it supports HTTP out of the box, it's designed with WebSockets, events, and other protocols in mind from the start.

- Not opinionated about your project structure ‚Äì It provides suggested patterns, but doesn‚Äôt enforce strict architectural rules, allowing for flexibility.

- Not ORM-locked ‚Äì AvleonJS doesn't assume a specific ORM or database layer. You can use raw SQL, Prisma, Drizzle, TypeORM, or even in-memory adapters.

- Not monolithic ‚Äì It's built for microservices and modular applications, with first-class support for context separation, service discovery, and dynamic scoping.

## Framework Comparison: AvleonJS vs NestJS vs Fastify

| **Dependency Injection (DI)**    | ‚úÖ TypeDI-based, lightweight, flexible                | ‚úÖ Powerful but tightly coupled                      | ‚ùå None (requires manual DI or 3rd-party plugins) |
| **OpenAPI/Swagger Support**      | ‚úÖ Via custom decorators (e.g., `@OpenApi`)           | ‚úÖ Rich support (`@ApiProperty`, etc.)               | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires plugin and manual schema definition  |
| **Modularity**                   | ‚úÖ File-based + explicit modules                      | ‚úÖ Structured modules, hierarchical                  | ‚ö†Ô∏è No standard ‚Äî up to user                      |
| **Performance**                  | ‚ö° Fast and extensible (built on top of Fastify)      | üê¢ Slower due to reflection-heavy metadata          | ‚ö° Extremely fast, highly optimized               |
| **Learning Curve**               | üöÄ Smooth and intuitive for TypeScript users         | üìö Steeper due to complexity and abstraction        | üöÄ Easy to start, more DIY for advanced use      |
| **CLI Tooling**                  | ‚úÖ Simple generators, focused on backend needs        | ‚úÖ Extensive CLI                                     | ‚ùå Minimal or external tooling                    |

‚úÖ Choose AvleonJS if:
You need real-time and event-driven features out of the box.

You want fine-grained, scoped access control (not just roles).

You prefer low-boilerplate but still want structure and modularity.

You want performance without sacrificing TypeScript ergonomics.
